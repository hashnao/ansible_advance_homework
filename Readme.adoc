= Ansible Tower Homework Lab Instruction

== Prerequisites

First deploy the following environments through the OpenTLC lab.

* _Ansible Advanced - Homework_
* _Ansible Advanced - OpenStack_

NOTE: The OpenTLC lab has limits that only 3 labs can be deployed.
This homework deploys 3 labs finally, so remove all the labs if you already have any.

* Connect to the workstation host for _Ansible Advanced - Homework_.
